## Course Description
This course introduces the applications of Artificial Intelligence: Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Dialog System and Multi-Modal Dialog System. Futhermore, this course will dive into the concepts and the state-of-the-art algorithms of Natural Language Processing. We will introduce corpra, tokenization, stop word processing, word2vector, neural network, RNN, LSTM, and BERT etc. Finally, we will discuss how to apply the algorithms and concepts to the dialog system.
